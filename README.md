### What is AnimeBnb?
AnimeBnb is a dynamic application that emulates the core functionalities of AirBnb; Users are able to utilize user-created spots stored in the database to create/update/delete custom anime-inspired spots that they can share with other users to review!

### Why AnimeBnb?
This project was my first big milestone as a software developer; I wanted to create a functional application that is easy to interact with and can be relatable to other people who love anime!
